# Flutter Portfolio Feedback Analysis


## 📊 Categorization of Feedback

### 🎨 Design
- 🚫 Moving lights in the background are distracting and annoying
- 🎭 The creepy avatar needs to go
- 📝 Bold text is inconsistent; unify or simplify
- 🔤 Fonts and contrast could be improved for better readability
- 🖱️ Cursor animation is distracting
- 📱 Projects section appears like plain text; lacks visual appeal

### 🎯 Usability
- 📜 Indicate which boxes contain scrollable content
- 🔘 Make buttons and interactive elements more obvious
- 💡 Tooltip for tools and technologies would help non-tech visitors
- 📱 Mobile optimization is poor; ensure a 'mobile-first' design approach

### ⚡ Performance
- ⏳ Loading time is too long; consider removing the loading screen
- 🐌 Sluggish performance on mobile and certain browsers
- 🔄 Rendering-heavy background effects make the site unresponsive
- 🌐 Ensure compatibility with different browsers like Firefox and Safari

### 📝 Content
- 📄 About Me page feels unnecessary; focus on professional details
- 💼 Projects are too basic and lack uniqueness
- 🔒 Personal details like phone numbers shouldn't be public
- 📚 High school/kindergarten info is irrelevant for hiring managers

### ⚙️ Functionality
- 🎬 Animations and transitions have bugs (e.g., project page animation)
- 🔄 Navigation widget doesn't update on browser back navigation
- 📄 Allow resume viewing directly instead of only offering downloads
