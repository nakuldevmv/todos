![alt text](https://codembedded.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/862ac-8051_interrupt.png)

### What is an Interrupt?

* A signal that tells the CPU to pause the current task and run a **special routine** (ISR).
* Used to handle **urgent tasks** like input signal, timer overflow, data received, etc.

### 8051 Has 5 Interrupt Sources:

| Interrupt | Vector Address | Trigger             |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| INT0      | 0003H          | External pin (P3.2) |
| TF0       | 000BH          | Timer 0 overflow    |
| INT1      | 0013H          | External pin (P3.3) |
| TF1       | 001BH          | Timer 1 overflow    |
| Serial    | 0023H          | TX/RX complete      |

### Registers:

* **IE (Interrupt Enable):** Enable/disable specific interrupts
* **IP (Interrupt Priority):** Set high or low priority
* **TCON:** Edge/level control for external interrupts

### ISR Flow:

1. Interrupt occurs
2. MCU finishes current instruction
3. Saves return address (PC)
4. Jumps to ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)
5. Executes task
6. Returns using `RETI`

### Example:

```asm
ORG 0003H       ; INT0 vector
CLR P1.0        ; ISR task
RETI            ; Return to main
```

## üî∑ 1. Memory and I/O Devices Interfacing

### üîπ What is Interfacing?

Interfacing means **connecting external components** (memory chips or I/O devices) to the microcontroller so it can **read from inputs** and **send commands to outputs**.

---

### üîπ Memory Interfacing

#### üîß Why?

* Internal memory of microcontrollers is limited.
* For large programs or data, **external memory** (RAM/ROM/EEPROM) is connected.

#### üîß What‚Äôs Needed?

* **Address Bus** (16-bit): Points to memory locations
* **Data Bus** (8-bit): Carries actual data
* **Control Lines**:

  * `RD` ‚Äì Read enable
  * `WR` ‚Äì Write enable
  * `CS` ‚Äì Chip Select

#### üîß How it Works:

* CPU sends address through address bus.
* Activates control lines.
* Data flows through data bus.

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `8051 external memory interfacing diagram`

---

### üîπ I/O Device Interfacing

#### üß† I/O Devices:

* **Input devices**: switches, sensors
* **Output devices**: LEDs, displays, buzzers, motors

#### üîß Two Types:

1. **Memory-Mapped I/O**

   * Devices share the same address space as memory.
   * Uses standard instructions like `MOV`.

2. **I/O-Mapped I/O (Isolated I/O)**

   * Special I/O instructions (`IN`, `OUT`).
   * Used in architectures like Intel x86.

#### üîß Techniques:

* **Polling**: Continuously checking device status
* **Interrupts**: Device notifies when it needs attention

## üî∑ 2. Programming Embedded Systems in C

### üîπ Why Use Embedded C?

| Normal C               | Embedded C                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Runs on OS             | Runs on microcontroller                  |
| Focus on logic         | Focus on **timing, memory, and control** |
| Uses `main()` with I/O | Uses **registers**, ports, timers, etc.  |

### üîπ Key Features:

* **Direct register access**: `P1 = 0xFF;`
* **Efficient memory handling**: `static`, `volatile`
* **No standard libraries** ‚Äì everything's custom
* **Infinite loops**: `while(1)` for continuous running
* **Low-level control** over hardware

---

### üîπ Embedded C Structure:

```c
#include <reg51.h> // header for 8051

void main() {
  while(1) {
    P1 = 0x0F; // send data to port
  }
}
```

#### üîß Important Headers:

* `<reg51.h>` for 8051 registers
* `<intrins.h>` for low-level bit instructions

#### üîß Key Operations:

* Controlling ports
* Using `delay()` via loops/timers
* Accessing I/O pins like `P1_0`, `P2_5`

---

## üî∑ 3. Need for RTOS

> RTOS = Real-Time Operating System.
> Used when your system has to **do multiple things on time**, every time.

---

### üîπ Why Not Normal OS?

| Normal OS                  | RTOS                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Focuses on user experience | Focuses on **timely task execution**             |
| Delays acceptable          | **Delays are dangerous** (Ex: airbag deployment) |

---

### üîπ What RTOS Does:

* **Manages multiple tasks**
* **Prioritizes** critical tasks
* Enables **real-time deadlines**
* Handles **task switching** with precision

#### üîß Applications:

* Medical devices (timing critical)
* Flight systems
* Robotics
* Industrial automation

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `RTOS architecture diagram in embedded systems`

---

## üî∑ 4. Multiple Tasks and Processes

> A task = a function or block of logic to be executed.
> RTOS handles **many tasks at the same time**, without crashing.

---

### üîπ How It Works:

* Each task has:

  * Stack
  * Context
  * Priority
* Tasks are scheduled and executed based on **priority and availability**.

---

### üîπ Task States in RTOS:

| State         | Meaning                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Ready**     | Task is waiting for CPU  |
| **Running**   | Currently executing      |
| **Blocked**   | Waiting for I/O or delay |
| **Suspended** | Task is paused manually  |

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `RTOS task state diagram`

---

### üîß Example:

Task 1: Read temperature every 5 sec
Task 2: Send data to cloud every 1 min
Task 3: Alert if temp > threshold

üí° RTOS ensures all these run smoothly using task scheduling.

---

## üî∑ 5. Context Switching

### üß† What is Context?

Context = **Snapshot** of a task‚Äôs current state.
Includes:

* CPU registers
* Program Counter
* Stack pointer
* Flags

---

### üîÅ Context Switching Process:

1. Save the current task‚Äôs context
2. Load the new task‚Äôs context
3. Start/resume execution of new task

---

### üîß Why Important?

* Enables **multitasking**
* Keeps system consistent
* Ensures **data is not lost** when switching

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `context switching RTOS diagram`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Example Situation:

Task A is sending data to server
Interrupt occurs
Task B (sensor reading) starts
After it's done, RTOS switches back to Task A ‚Äî exactly where it left off

---

## üî∑ 6. Priority-Based Scheduling Policies

This is how RTOS decides **which task gets the CPU**.

---

### üîπ Scheduling Policies:

#### ‚úÖ **1. Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

* Higher priority task **interrupts lower** one
* Critical tasks handled ASAP
* Example: Fire alarm interrupting music playback

#### ‚úÖ **2. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

* Current task **finishes fully**
* Lower overhead, simple
* Example: Washing machine completing a wash cycle

#### ‚úÖ **3. Round Robin with Priority**

* Equal priority tasks take turns
* Balanced CPU usage
* Fair in systems like printers, ticket machines

---

### üîß When to Use What?

| System Type               | Scheduling     |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Life-critical (Pacemaker) | Preemptive     |
| Office automation         | Round Robin    |
| Simple devices            | Non-preemptive |

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `priority based scheduling in RTOS diagram`

---

### üß† Real-World Example:

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a **smart agriculture system**:

* Task 1: Sensor reads soil moisture (High priority)
* Task 2: Update mobile app UI (Medium priority)
* Task 3: Store data to SD card (Low priority)

RTOS makes sure Task 1 **always runs first**, ensuring the crops get watered at the right time.

### üî∑ **Interrupt Execution Flow**

1. Interrupt occurs üõéÔ∏è
2. Current instruction is finished
3. CPU jumps to the **vector address**
4. Executes the **ISR**
5. `RETI` is executed
6. Control returns to main program

---

## üîÅ **Using Timer with Interrupt Example**

Timer can overflow and trigger an interrupt automatically:

```c
TMOD = 0x01;       // Timer 0, Mode 1
TH0 = 0xFC; TL0 = 0x66;  
IE = 0x82;         // Enable Timer 0 interrupt
TR0 = 1;           // Start timer

void Timer0_ISR(void) interrupt 1 {
  // Action when timer overflows
  TH0 = 0xFC; TL0 = 0x66; // Reload timer
}
```

---

## üî∑ Why Are Timers + Interrupts Important?

* Enables **real-time responses** to events
* Allows **multi-tasking** without polling
* Improves **efficiency** in embedded systems
* Essential for **alarm systems**, **sensor alerts**, **timed tasks**, etc.

# Unit 2




## üß† **Priority-Based Scheduling Policies**

**Subject:** Embedded Systems & IoT (CS3691)
**Unit II ‚Äì Embedded C Programming**
**Exam Marks:** 13-mark style
**diagram: true**
üîç *Google Search:* `RTOS priority scheduling diagram`, `task scheduling in embedded systems`

---

### üî∑ 1. **What is Scheduling in RTOS?**

In **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**, **scheduling** is the mechanism that decides *which task runs at what time* based on its **priority, timing constraints, and system state**.

* Embedded systems run **multiple tasks**
* Not all tasks are equal ‚Üí some are **time-sensitive**
* RTOS uses scheduling policies to pick **which task runs first**

---

### üî∑ 2. **What is Priority-Based Scheduling?**

It‚Äôs a **task scheduling method** where each task is assigned a **priority number**.
üü¢ Higher-priority task = runs before lower-priority ones
üî¥ If multiple tasks are ready ‚Üí the scheduler picks the **one with the highest priority**

---

### üî∑ 3. **Types of Priority-Based Scheduling**

Let‚Äôs break it down into two main categories:

#### ‚úÖ **A. Static Priority Scheduling**

* Priority is **fixed** at the time of task creation
* Cannot be changed during execution
* Common in **hard real-time systems** (e.g., medical monitors)

üí° *Example:*
Task A (priority 1), Task B (priority 2)
‚Äì> Task B always gets the CPU first

#### ‚úÖ **B. Dynamic Priority Scheduling**

* Task priorities can **change at runtime**
* Based on rules like **deadline**, **execution time**, etc.
* More flexible for **soft real-time systems**

üí° *Example:* Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
‚Äì> Task closest to its deadline gets CPU

---

### üî∑ 4. **Common Priority-Based Scheduling Policies**

| Policy                              | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preemptive Priority**             | Higher priority task *interrupts* the currently running lower one            |
| **Non-Preemptive Priority**         | Running task completes first, even if a higher priority task becomes ready   |
| **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** | Priority assigned based on task frequency (shorter period = higher priority) |
| **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**   | Dynamic; task with earliest deadline runs first                              |

---

### üî∑ 5. **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive ‚Äì Key Difference**

| Aspect            | Preemptive                              | Non-Preemptive  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Interruption      | Allowed if higher priority task appears | Not allowed     |
| Context Switching | More frequent                           | Less frequent   |
| Use Case          | Time-critical systems                   | Simpler systems |

---

### üî∑ 6. **Diagram Explanation**

Preemptive Scheduling

![alt text](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/categories_of_process_scheduling.jpg)

Show a timeline with Task A, B, and C executing based on priorities to explain:

* Task B preempts Task C
* Task A runs first if highest priority
* Context switch markers between tasks

---

### üî∑ 7. **Priority Inversion Problem (Hot Topic!)**

üß® **What is it?**
Lower-priority task **holds a resource** needed by a higher-priority task ‚Üí higher-priority task is stuck

üõ†Ô∏è **Solution:**

* **Priority Inheritance Protocol** ‚Üí temporarily boost the priority of lower-priority task

---

### üî∑ 8. **Real-Life Embedded Example**

üëâ In a **smart home** device:

* Fire alarm sensor task (high priority)
* Data logging task (medium)
* LED blinking task (low priority)

‚û°Ô∏è Scheduler ensures fire alarm task **preempts everything else**

---

### üî∑ 9. **Why Priority-Based Scheduling is Used in Embedded Systems**

* Ensures **real-time deadlines** are met
* Gives control over **task execution**
* Suitable for **resource-constrained** environments
* Avoids unnecessary CPU load

## üß† **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

---
![alt text](https://tridentinfosol.com/assets/img/portfolio/rtos.jpg)
### üî∑ 1. **What is an RTOS?**

An **RTOS** is an operating system designed to **run tasks within strict timing constraints**.
It ensures that tasks are **executed predictably and on time**, which is crucial in **embedded systems** like:

* Pacemakers
* Car airbags
* Industrial robots
* Smartwatches

‚è±Ô∏è **Real-time = deterministic behavior**

---

### üî∑ 2. **Why Do We Need an RTOS?**

RTOS is needed because:

‚úÖ Embedded systems often handle **multiple tasks** simultaneously
‚úÖ Tasks may have **different urgency levels**
‚úÖ Delays in response can cause **failures** (e.g., delay in airbag = disaster)

**Benefits:**

* Predictable response time (deterministic)
* Efficient task management
* Multitasking support
* Time sharing & real-time scheduling

---

### üî∑ 3. **How Does an RTOS Work? (Simplified)**

RTOS works by:

1. Maintaining a **task table** (with all tasks and their priorities)
2. Using a **scheduler** to decide which task runs next
3. Handling **context switching** to switch between tasks
4. Using **inter-process communication (IPC)** methods (like semaphores, queues)
5. Running **interrupts** instantly when external events occur

**diagram: true**
üîç Google: `RTOS architecture block diagram`

---

### üî∑ 4. **Types of RTOS**

| Type          | Description                                    | Use Case                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Hard RTOS** | Strict deadlines; delay = failure              | Pacemakers, Anti-lock brakes |
| **Soft RTOS** | Deadlines preferred but not critical           | Music player, Messaging app  |
| **Firm RTOS** | Occasional delays okay, but may reduce quality | Video calls, Streaming       |

---

### üî∑ 5. **RTOS Task States**

Every task in RTOS exists in one of the following **states**:

**diagram: true**
üîç Google: `RTOS task state diagram`

![text](https://www.digikey.com/maker-media/85de44fb-1e6d-4234-a6d4-e10e4dce1111)


| State          | Meaning                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Ready**      | Task is ready to run, waiting for CPU          |
| **Running**    | Task is currently executing                    |
| **Blocked**    | Waiting for event/resource (e.g., input, data) |
| **Suspended**  | Task is paused manually or by system           |
| **Terminated** | Task has finished execution                    |

üåÄ **Scheduler** is the component that switches tasks between these states.

---

### üî∑ 6. **Key Components of an RTOS**

* **Scheduler** ‚Üí picks which task runs
* **Task/Thread Manager** ‚Üí manages multiple tasks
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** ‚Üí tasks talk via queues, mailboxes
* **Clock Manager** ‚Üí tracks time, delays
* **Interrupt Handler** ‚Üí handles real-time interrupts

---

### üî∑ 7. **Context Switching in RTOS**

When the CPU switches from one task to another:

* **Saves the state** (registers, PC, etc.) of current task
* **Loads the state** of the next task
  üîÅ Happens **fast**, but adds some **overhead**

---

### üî∑ 8. **Real-Life Example**

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a **smart home security system**:

* Task 1: Monitor door sensor (high priority)
* Task 2: Record video (medium)
* Task 3: Blink LED (low priority)

RTOS will:

* Ensure **Task 1 always runs first**
* Preempt others if needed
* Handle all smoothly and in **real-time**

---

<br><br>



---

### üî∑ What is Context Switching?

**Context Switching** is the process where the CPU **pauses one task**, **saves its current state**, and **switches to another task**.
It‚Äôs like a **bookmark** for the CPU ‚Äî it marks where it left off and continues from there later.

**diagram: true**
üîç Google: `context switching in RTOS diagram`

---

### üî∑ Why is Context Switching Needed?

Because embedded systems often run **multiple tasks**, and we need to:

* **Switch quickly** between tasks based on **priority**
* **Pause one task**, run a **more urgent task**
* **Avoid data loss** when switching

üí° Used heavily in **RTOS**, where task switching happens based on **schedulers**.

---

### üî∑ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Let‚Äôs say Task A is running, and Task B becomes ready:

1. **Save current state** of Task A
   (Registers, Program Counter, Stack, etc.)
2. **Load saved state** of Task B
3. CPU resumes execution of Task B from where it left off
4. Later, switch back to Task A (from saved state)

‚è±Ô∏è This whole process happens in **microseconds** but has a small **overhead**.

---

### üî∑ Key Components Involved

* **Program Counter (PC)** ‚Äì stores current instruction location
* **Stack Pointer (SP)** ‚Äì tracks function call stack
* **Register values** ‚Äì all active data in use
* **Task Control Block (TCB)** ‚Äì where all this info is stored for each task

---

### üî∑ Example for Better Clarity

Imagine you‚Äôre running:

* Task 1: Read temperature sensor
* Task 2: Display data on screen

If Task 1 is reading and suddenly an **interrupt** fires from Task 2 (user pressed a button), the RTOS will:

* Save Task 1‚Äôs context
* Execute Task 2
* After completion, **restore Task 1‚Äôs state** and continue as if nothing happened

---

### üî∑ Context Switching in RTOS

In RTOS, **context switching** is handled by the **scheduler** and is based on:

* **Priorities** (e.g., Task A is more urgent than B)
* **Scheduling Policy** (Round Robin, Rate Monotonic, etc.)
* **Interrupts** (which may force switch instantly)

---

### üî∑ Overhead of Context Switching

| Pros                     | Cons                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Enables multitasking     | Uses CPU time (overhead)     |
| Handles priority         | Slight performance loss      |
| Supports real-time needs | Complex in low-power systems |

üîå In **real-time systems**, the **overhead must be minimal**, or it can miss deadlines.

---

### üî∑ Real-Life Analogy üéÆ

Imagine you're playing a video game (Task A), and your mom calls you (Task B):

* You **pause the game** (save state)
* You **attend the call**
* After the call, you **resume the game from where you left off**

That‚Äôs **context switching**. Simple but powerful.

## üî∑ What Makes Embedded C Special?

| Regular C                 | Embedded C                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Runs on PCs               | Runs on microcontrollers             |
| Uses standard libraries   | Uses microcontroller-specific libs   |
| No hardware access needed | Direct hardware access via registers |
| No timing constraints     | Must meet real-time deadlines        |

---

## üî∑ Key Concepts in Embedded C

### 1. **Direct Register Access**

Used to control I/O ports:

```c
P1 = 0xFF;  // Set Port 1 pins as HIGH
```

### 2. **Bitwise Operations**

Used to toggle, set, or clear specific pins:

```c
P1 |= (1<<0);  // Set bit 0 of Port 1
```

### 3. **Delay Functions**

Used to create pauses:

```c
for(int i=0; i<10000; i++);  // crude delay
```

### 4. **Interrupt Service Routines**

Embedded C allows using ISRs (interrupt service routines) directly:

```c
void timer0_ISR(void) interrupt 1 {
   // Code when Timer 0 overflows
}
```

---

## üî∑ Structure of Embedded C Program

```c
#include <reg51.h>        // MCU-specific header file

void main() {
   P1 = 0x00;             // Initialize Port 1
   while(1) {
      P1 = 0xFF;          // Turn all LEDs ON
      delay();
      P1 = 0x00;          // Turn all LEDs OFF
      delay();
   }
}

void delay() {
   int i;
   for(i=0;i<30000;i++); // simple delay
}
```

‚úÖ **Main()** function
‚úÖ **Initialization**
‚úÖ **Continuous loop (while(1))**
‚úÖ **Hardware control using registers**

## üìö **Memory and I/O Devices Interfacing**

**diagram: true**
üîç Search: `Memory and I/O interfacing in embedded systems diagram`

---

### üß† What‚Äôs ‚ÄúInterfacing‚Äù Anyway?

**Interfacing** just means **connecting** external stuff (like memory or sensors) to your microcontroller so they can **talk to each other and work together**.

Think of the microcontroller as a brain üß†. It **needs memory** to think and **I/O devices** (like LEDs, buttons, sensors) to feel or act.

---

## üî∏ 1. Memory Interfacing

üíæ You connect **external memory** when:

* Internal memory of microcontroller is not enough
* You need faster or specialized memory (like EEPROM, Flash)

### üîß How It Works:

* Microcontroller sends an **address** to memory via **address bus**
* Sends or receives **data** via **data bus**
* Uses **control signals** to read/write (like `RD` or `WR`)

üóÇÔ∏è Two types of memory interfacing:

1. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** ‚Äì Stores permanent programs
2. **RAM (Random Access Memory)** ‚Äì Stores temporary data during execution

‚è±Ô∏è Uses address decoders to select memory ranges.

---

## üî∏ 2. I/O Devices Interfacing

This is all about **connecting external components** (LEDs, sensors, motors, switches, etc.) to **Input/Output pins** of your microcontroller.

### üñ•Ô∏è Two Types:

* **Input devices** ‚Üí Like sensors or switches (send data IN)
* **Output devices** ‚Üí Like LEDs or motors (get data OUT)

### üß∞ How It‚Äôs Done:

* I/O devices are connected to **I/O ports** (P0 to P3 in 8051)
* The microcontroller sends **HIGH/LOW** signals to control them

```c
P1 = 0xFF;  // Turns ON all pins in Port 1
```

üìå Example:

* **LED** on Port 2 ‚Üí ON when pin is HIGH
* **Push button** ‚Üí Reads as 1 (pressed), 0 (not pressed)

## Integration of Sensors and Actuators

## üß† What Does ‚ÄúIntegration‚Äù Mean?

It means **connecting sensors and actuators to the Arduino**, and writing the code so they **talk to each other** ‚Äî like:

* **Sensors**: Give data (e.g., temperature, light, motion).
* **Actuators**: Do stuff based on that data (e.g., turn on fan, light, motor).

---

## üß© Types of Integration

### 1. **Digital Sensors**

* Sensors that give only `HIGH` or `LOW` values.
* Example: **IR sensor**, **PIR motion sensor**

```cpp
int pir = 2;
int led = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pir, INPUT);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int motion = digitalRead(pir);
  if (motion == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH); // Motion detected: Turn ON LED
  } else {
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);  // No motion: Turn OFF LED
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Analog Sensors**

* Gives a **range of values** (0‚Äì1023).
* Example: **LDR**, **Potentiometer**, **Temp sensors (LM35)**

```cpp
int sensor = A0;
int led = 9;

void loop() {
  int val = analogRead(sensor);
  analogWrite(led, val / 4); // Convert 0‚Äì1023 to 0‚Äì255 for brightness
}
```

---

### 3. **Actuators**

* Devices that **perform actions** based on commands.
* Common ones:

  * **LEDs** (light)
  * **Buzzers** (sound)
  * **Motors** (motion)
  * **Relays** (switch bigger things like fans)

---

## üîÑ Full Integration Example

Let‚Äôs say:

* **Input**: LDR senses darkness
* **Output**: Motor (fan) runs in dark

```cpp
int ldr = A0;
int motor = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(motor, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int light = analogRead(ldr);
  if (light < 500) {
    digitalWrite(motor, HIGH);  // It's dark: Turn ON motor
  } else {
    digitalWrite(motor, LOW);   // Bright: Turn OFF
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Arduino Handles It

| Arduino Does...  | Example                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `analogRead()`   | Reads sensor input                       |
| `digitalWrite()` | Turns actuators ON/OFF                   |
| `analogWrite()`  | Controls actuator speed (like dim light) |
| `pinMode()`      | Sets up pin direction                    |

## üì¶ Pro Tip

Always check:

* **Power** (does the sensor need 5V or 3.3V?)
* **Pin type** (digital or analog?)
* **Libraries** (some sensors like DHT11 need them)

### üîå A. **Network Layer Protocols**

These move data between devices & cloud.

#### üßä **IP (Internet Protocol)**

* Used in Internet-based communication.
* IPv6 is more suitable due to IoT's large device count.

---

### üì® B. **Transport Layer Protocols**

#### üåê **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

* Reliable (guarantees delivery)
* Slower.
* Used for apps where data **must** arrive correctly (e.g., firmware updates).

#### üì° **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

* Faster, but no guarantee of delivery.
* Used in **real-time data** (e.g., live temperature streaming).

---

### üîÑ C. **Application Layer Protocols**

These define *how* IoT devices share data.

### ‚úÖ 1. **Request-Response (Client-Server) Model**

* **How it works:**
  Client (device) sends a request ‚û°Ô∏è Server responds.
  It‚Äôs synchronous ‚Äî the client waits for a response.

* **Example:**
  Smart sensor sending temperature data to a cloud server and waiting for acknowledgment.

* **Protocol used:** HTTP

* **Use case:** REST APIs, sensor reading, control commands

* **How it works:**
  Devices (publishers) send messages to a **broker**.
  Subscribers get updates from the broker **only for topics they subscribed to.**

* **Example:**
  Smart bulb subscribes to ‚Äúroom/light‚Äù topic.
  App publishes ‚ÄúON‚Äù to that topic ‚Üí bulb receives it.

* **Protocols used:** MQTT, AMQP

* **Use case:** Real-time control, notifications, chat-like systems

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Push-Pull Model**

* **How it works:**

  Consumers (pullers) pick data when needed.

* **Example:**
  Weather sensors pushing data to a queue.
  Analytics engine pulls only when needed.

* **Protocols used:** AMQP, HTTP

* **Use case:** Efficient data processing pipelines.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Exclusive Pair Model (1:1 communication)**

* **How it works:**
  Direct connection between two endpoints for private, secure communication.

* **Example:**
  BLE communication between fitness band and smartphone.

* **Use case:** Wearables, personal IoT gadgets

Zigbee is a **low-power, low-data rate, wireless communication protocol** built on **IEEE 802.15.4** standard. It‚Äôs designed for **short-range communication** in IoT devices like smart lighting, energy meters, home automation, etc.

---

## üß† Key Features:

* **Range**: \~10 to 100 meters
* **Data Rate**: 20 Kbps ‚Äì 250 Kbps
* **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz (global), 868 MHz (EU), 915 MHz (USA)
* **Power Usage**: Super low üîã
* **Ideal for**: Sensor networks, home automation, industrial monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Zigbee Network Architecture

Zigbee networks use a **star**, **tree**, or **mesh** topology.

### 1. **Zigbee Coordinator (ZC)**

* Only one per network
* Starts the network, assigns PAN ID
* Stores info about the network

### 2. **Zigbee Router (ZR)**

* Extends network range
* Forwards data to other nodes
* Can connect with other routers or end devices

### 3. **Zigbee End Device (ZED)**

* Has limited functionality
* Communicates only with its parent (ZC or ZR)
* Lowest power consumption (used in sensors, remotes)

üß† Think of ZC as the "brain", ZRs as the "roads", and ZEDs as the "houses"!

## üîÑ Types of Topologies

### üåü Star Topology:

* All devices talk to the Coordinator directly
* Easy, but range-limited

### üå≥ Tree Topology:

* Routers help build a tree structure
* More scalable than star

### üï∏Ô∏è Mesh Topology:

* Devices can communicate with many neighbors
* Highly reliable, self-healing

## üì∂ Working of Zigbee Network

1. **Coordinator forms network**, assigns PAN ID.
2. **Routers join** to relay data and expand range.
3. **End Devices join** under routers/coordinator.
4. Devices exchange data using short-range radio and sleep often to save power.
