## ✅ UNIT III – WIND ENERGY


### 🔹 1. **Wind Energy Principles**

**🔑 Basic Idea:**

* Wind energy is **kinetic energy of moving air**, caused by **solar heating** and **Earth’s rotation**.
* Wind turbines convert this kinetic energy into **mechanical**, then **electrical energy**.

**⚡ Power Equation:**

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot V^3
$$

Where:

* ρ = Air density (kg/m³)
* A = Swept area of rotor (m²)
* V = Wind speed (m/s)

**Key Point:** Power is **proportional to cube of wind speed** → Even a small increase in speed = massive boost in power output.

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind energy power equation with turbine blade diagram`

---

### 🔹 2. **Wind Site and Resource Assessment**

**Why Site Selection Matters:**

* Wind varies by location. Choosing the wrong site = poor performance & losses.

**🛠️ Tools Used:**

* **Anemometer** – measures wind speed 🌬️
* **Wind Vane** – direction of wind 🧭
* **Wind Rose** – shows frequency of wind directions (pie chart style)
* **LiDAR / SoDAR** – advanced tools to assess wind profile at various heights

**Ideal Site Features:**

* Consistent wind speeds (> 5 m/s at 10m height)
* Low turbulence (flat, open terrain preferred)
* No major obstructions nearby (buildings, trees)
* Available space for rotor blades & tower setup

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind rose diagram site assessment`

---

### 🔹 3. **Wind Assessment**

**Purpose:** Estimate the wind resource and energy output before installing a turbine.

**Key Techniques:**

**Output:** Wind speed distribution curve (Weibull distribution), monthly averages, and wind energy map of the site.

---

### 🔹 4. **Factors Influencing Wind**

Understanding these helps in better **site planning** and **performance prediction**:

* **Temperature Difference**: Hot air rises → creates pressure difference → wind
* **Altitude**: Wind speed increases with height above ground
* **Coriolis Effect**: Due to Earth’s rotation → wind direction is deflected
* **Topography**: Hills, valleys, forests affect speed & turbulence

📌 **Diagram: Required**
🔍 *Search:* `tidal power plant components block diagram`

**Tidal Energy Principle:**
Uses the **rise and fall of sea level** due to moon's gravity to produce electricity.

**Main Components:**

1. **Barrage (Dam-like structure):**

   * Built across an estuary.
2. **Tidal Basin:**

   * Stores high tide water.
3. **Sluice Gates:**

   * Controls water flow.
4. **Turbines:**

   * Spins during in-flow and out-flow.

**Working:**

* Water stored during high tide → released during low tide → spins turbines → generates electricity.

### **6. Describe the working principle of HATT and VATT.**

📌 **Diagram: Optional but useful**
🔍 *Search:* `HATT vs VATT diagram`

These are types of **hydrokinetic turbines** (used in tidal/wave energy systems):

**1. HATT (Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbine):**

* Axis of rotation is parallel to water flow.
* Like a wind turbine under water.
* High efficiency in fast-moving tides.
* Needs flow direction alignment.

**2. VATT (Vertical Axis Tidal Turbine):**

* Axis perpendicular to water flow.
* Works regardless of flow direction.
* Easier installation, less efficient.
* More drag losses than HATT.

**Comparison:**

| Feature        | HATT          | VATT             |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Axis           | Horizontal    | Vertical         |
| Directionality | One direction | Omni-directional |
| Efficiency     | High          | Moderate         |
| Installation   | Complex       | Easier           |
