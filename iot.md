## üîπ 5. **Timers and Serial Port**

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Timers in 8051

**diagram: true**
Search: `8051 timer block diagram`
[Timer And Counter GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/electronics-engineering/8051-timers-and-counters/)

* **Timer 0 & Timer 1** ‚Äì can be used as **timers** (for delays) or **counters** (for event counting).
* Controlled using registers:

  * `TMOD` ‚Äì Mode selection
  * `TCON` ‚Äì Control operations (start, overflow flags)
  * `THx/TLx` ‚Äì High and Low byte for count

#### Modes of Timer:

| Mode | Bit-size          | Use                     |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0    | 13-bit            | Rarely used             |
| 1    | 16-bit            | Normal timing           |
| 2    | 8-bit auto-reload | Repeats automatically   |
| 3    | Split mode        | Only Timer 0 gets split |

### Example:

```asm
MOV TMOD, #01H     ; Timer 0, Mode 1 (16-bit)
MOV TH0, #0FCH
MOV TL0, #066H      ; Load count
SETB TR0            ; Start Timer 0
```

  * `TI/RI`: Transmit and receive complete flags

### Baud Rate Setting:

* Controlled via **Timer 1** in auto-reload mode

### Serial Transmission Example:

SETB TR1           ; Start Timer1
MOV SBUF, #'A'     ; Transmit char 'A'
WAIT: JNB TI, WAIT ; Wait for complete
CLR TI             ; Clear transmit flag
```

## üîπ 6. **Interrupt Handling in 8051**

![alt text](https://codembedded.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/862ac-8051_interrupt.png)

### What is an Interrupt?

* A signal that tells the CPU to pause the current task and run a **special routine** (ISR).
* Used to handle **urgent tasks** like input signal, timer overflow, data received, etc.

### 8051 Has 5 Interrupt Sources:

| Interrupt | Vector Address | Trigger             |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| INT0      | 0003H          | External pin (P3.2) |
| TF0       | 000BH          | Timer 0 overflow    |
| INT1      | 0013H          | External pin (P3.3) |
| TF1       | 001BH          | Timer 1 overflow    |
| Serial    | 0023H          | TX/RX complete      |

### Registers:

* **IE (Interrupt Enable):** Enable/disable specific interrupts
* **IP (Interrupt Priority):** Set high or low priority
* **TCON:** Edge/level control for external interrupts

### ISR Flow:

1. Interrupt occurs
2. MCU finishes current instruction
3. Saves return address (PC)
4. Jumps to ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)
5. Executes task
6. Returns using `RETI`

### Example:

```asm
ORG 0003H       ; INT0 vector
CLR P1.0        ; ISR task
RETI            ; Return to main
```

## üî∑ 1. Memory and I/O Devices Interfacing

### üîπ What is Interfacing?

Interfacing means **connecting external components** (memory chips or I/O devices) to the microcontroller so it can **read from inputs** and **send commands to outputs**.

---

### üîπ Memory Interfacing

#### üîß Why?

* Internal memory of microcontrollers is limited.
* For large programs or data, **external memory** (RAM/ROM/EEPROM) is connected.

#### üîß What‚Äôs Needed?

* **Address Bus** (16-bit): Points to memory locations
* **Data Bus** (8-bit): Carries actual data
* **Control Lines**:

  * `RD` ‚Äì Read enable
  * `WR` ‚Äì Write enable
  * `CS` ‚Äì Chip Select

#### üîß How it Works:

* CPU sends address through address bus.
* Activates control lines.
* Data flows through data bus.

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `8051 external memory interfacing diagram`

---

### üîπ I/O Device Interfacing

#### üß† I/O Devices:

* **Input devices**: switches, sensors
* **Output devices**: LEDs, displays, buzzers, motors

#### üîß Two Types:

1. **Memory-Mapped I/O**

   * Devices share the same address space as memory.
   * Uses standard instructions like `MOV`.

2. **I/O-Mapped I/O (Isolated I/O)**

   * Special I/O instructions (`IN`, `OUT`).
   * Used in architectures like Intel x86.

#### üîß Techniques:

* **Polling**: Continuously checking device status
* **Interrupts**: Device notifies when it needs attention

## üî∑ 2. Programming Embedded Systems in C

### üîπ Why Use Embedded C?

| Normal C               | Embedded C                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Runs on OS             | Runs on microcontroller                  |
| Focus on logic         | Focus on **timing, memory, and control** |
| Uses `main()` with I/O | Uses **registers**, ports, timers, etc.  |

### üîπ Key Features:

* **Direct register access**: `P1 = 0xFF;`
* **Efficient memory handling**: `static`, `volatile`
* **No standard libraries** ‚Äì everything's custom
* **Infinite loops**: `while(1)` for continuous running
* **Low-level control** over hardware

---

### üîπ Embedded C Structure:

```c
#include <reg51.h> // header for 8051

void main() {
  while(1) {
    P1 = 0x0F; // send data to port
  }
}
```

#### üîß Important Headers:

* `<reg51.h>` for 8051 registers
* `<intrins.h>` for low-level bit instructions

#### üîß Key Operations:

* Controlling ports
* Using `delay()` via loops/timers
* Accessing I/O pins like `P1_0`, `P2_5`

---

## üî∑ 3. Need for RTOS

> RTOS = Real-Time Operating System.
> Used when your system has to **do multiple things on time**, every time.

---

### üîπ Why Not Normal OS?

| Normal OS                  | RTOS                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Focuses on user experience | Focuses on **timely task execution**             |
| Delays acceptable          | **Delays are dangerous** (Ex: airbag deployment) |

---

### üîπ What RTOS Does:

* **Manages multiple tasks**
* **Prioritizes** critical tasks
* Enables **real-time deadlines**
* Handles **task switching** with precision

#### üîß Applications:

* Medical devices (timing critical)
* Flight systems
* Robotics
* Industrial automation

---

## üî∑ 4. Multiple Tasks and Processes

> A task = a function or block of logic to be executed.
> RTOS handles **many tasks at the same time**, without crashing.

---

### üîπ How It Works:

* Each task has:

  * Stack
  * Context
  * Priority
* Tasks are scheduled and executed based on **priority and availability**.

---

### üîπ Task States in RTOS:

| State         | Meaning                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Ready**     | Task is waiting for CPU  |
| **Running**   | Currently executing      |
| **Blocked**   | Waiting for I/O or delay |
| **Suspended** | Task is paused manually  |

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `RTOS task state diagram`

---

### üîß Example:

Task 1: Read temperature every 5 sec
Task 2: Send data to cloud every 1 min
Task 3: Alert if temp > threshold

üí° RTOS ensures all these run smoothly using task scheduling.

---

## üî∑ 5. Context Switching

### üß† What is Context?

Context = **Snapshot** of a task‚Äôs current state.
Includes:

* CPU registers
* Program Counter
* Stack pointer
* Flags

---

### üîÅ Context Switching Process:

1. Save the current task‚Äôs context
2. Load the new task‚Äôs context
3. Start/resume execution of new task

---

### üîß Why Important?

* Enables **multitasking**
* Keeps system consistent
* Ensures **data is not lost** when switching

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `context switching RTOS diagram`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Example Situation:

Task A is sending data to server
Interrupt occurs
Task B (sensor reading) starts
After it's done, RTOS switches back to Task A ‚Äî exactly where it left off

---

## üî∑ 6. Priority-Based Scheduling Policies

This is how RTOS decides **which task gets the CPU**.

---

### üîπ Scheduling Policies:

#### ‚úÖ **1. Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

* Higher priority task **interrupts lower** one
* Critical tasks handled ASAP
* Example: Fire alarm interrupting music playback

#### ‚úÖ **2. Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

* Current task **finishes fully**
* Lower overhead, simple
* Example: Washing machine completing a wash cycle

#### ‚úÖ **3. Round Robin with Priority**

* Equal priority tasks take turns
* Balanced CPU usage
* Fair in systems like printers, ticket machines

---

### üîß When to Use What?

| System Type               | Scheduling     |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Life-critical (Pacemaker) | Preemptive     |
| Office automation         | Round Robin    |
| Simple devices            | Non-preemptive |

üîç **diagram: true**
Search: `priority based scheduling in RTOS diagram`

---

### üß† Real-World Example:

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a **smart agriculture system**:

* Task 1: Sensor reads soil moisture (High priority)
* Task 2: Update mobile app UI (Medium priority)
* Task 3: Store data to SD card (Low priority)

RTOS makes sure Task 1 **always runs first**, ensuring the crops get watered at the right time.
