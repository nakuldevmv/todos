1. **Define cryptography and list its four primary goals.**
   Cryptography is the science of securing information by converting it into unreadable form; its goals are confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

2. **Differentiate between conventional (symmetric) and public-key cryptography.**
   Symmetric cryptography uses a single shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, whereas public-key (asymmetric) cryptography uses a public key for encryption and a separate private key for decryption.

3. **What is a hash function? Mention two essential properties of a secure hash function.**
   A hash function maps arbitrary-length input to a fixed-length output; two essential properties are preimage resistance and collision resistance.

4. **Explain the concept of authentication in computer security.**
   Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system before granting access to resources.

5. **What is a digital signature? Which cryptographic mechanisms does it involve?**
   A digital signature is an encrypted hash of a message that ensures integrity and authenticity; it involves hashing and asymmetric encryption.

### 1. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

* **Purpose**: Secure email and file encryption using hybrid cryptography
* **Process**:

  1. **Generate Session Key**: Random symmetric key (e.g., AES) to encrypt email body
  2. **Encrypt Message**: Use session key to encrypt data (faster than asymmetric for bulk)
  3. **Encrypt Session Key**: Use recipient’s public key to encrypt the session key
  4. **Digital Signature**: Hash plaintext, encrypt hash with sender’s private key, attach to message
  5. **Transmit**: Send encrypted session key + encrypted message + signature
  6. **Recipient**: Decrypt session key with private key, decrypt message, verify signature with sender’s public key
* **Security Services**: Confidentiality, Authentication, Integrity, Non-repudiation
* **diagram: true**

* **Components**:

  * **X.509 Certificates**: Issued by CA, bind user identity to public key
  * **CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)**: Defines structure for signed/encrypted messages
* **Process**:

  1. **Digital Signing**: Hash message, encrypt hash with sender’s private key → Signature
  2. **Encryption**: Encrypt message+signature with recipient’s public key
  3. **Transmission**: Send encrypted, signed email
  4. **Decryption**: Recipient decrypts with private key, verifies signature with sender’s public key
* **Applications**: Corporate email security, legal document exchange

### 3. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

* **Purpose**: Authenticate email sender’s domain and ensure message integrity
* **Mechanism**:

  1. **Generate Hash**: Sender computes hash over selected headers + body
  2. **Sign Hash**: Encrypt hash with domain’s private key → DKIM signature placed in email header
  3. **Publish Public Key**: Stored in DNS TXT record under `selector._domainkey.example.com`
  4. **Verification**: Receiver retrieves public key from DNS, decrypts signature, compares hash to recomputed value → Valid if match
* **Benefits**: Prevents email spoofing, improves deliverability, works with SPF/DMARC

**UNIT V SECURITY PRACTICES**

### 1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

* **Definition**: Systems that monitor network or host activities to detect malicious actions or policy violations
* **Types**:

  * **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**: Monitors individual hosts (file integrity checks, log analysis)
  * **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**: Monitors network traffic at strategic points (packet capture, protocol analysis)
* **Detection Approaches**:

  * **Signature-Based**: Matches traffic patterns against database of known attack signatures (fast, low false positives but cannot detect new attacks)
  * **Anomaly-Based**: Establishes baseline of normal behavior, flags deviations (can detect zero-day but higher false positives)
* **Components**:

  * **Sensors/Agents**: Collect data (logs, packets)
  * **Analysis Engine**: Compares data to rules or profiles
  * **Alerting System**: Notifies administrators on detection
* **Integration with IPS**: Intrusion Prevention Systems can block detected attacks in real time
* **diagram: true**

### 2. Password Management

* **Principles**:

  * **Password Complexity**: Minimum length, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars
  * **Password Storage**: Store hashed (salt + hash, e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), never plaintext
  * **Password Policies**: Expiration, reuse prevention, account lockout after failed attempts
  * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combine password with OTP, token, or biometric
* **Threats**:

  * **Brute-Force & Dictionary Attacks**: Automated guessing of common passwords
  * **Phishing & Social Engineering**: Trick users into revealing credentials

### 3. Firewall Characteristics and Types of Firewalls

* **Characteristics**:

  * **Traffic Filtering**: Block/allow based on IP address, port, protocol
  * **Stateful Inspection**: Track active connections, context-aware filtering
  * **Application Layer Filtering (Proxy)**: Inspect application data (HTTP, SMTP)
  * **Default Deny vs Default Allow**: Secure posture typically “deny by default”
  * **Logging & Alerting**: Record suspicious events, send alerts for anomalies
* **Types of Firewalls**:

  1. **Packet-Filtering Firewall**: Inspects packet headers (fast, limited context)
  2. **Stateful Inspection Firewall**: Tracks connection states (more secure, moderate performance)
  3. **Proxy (Application Layer) Firewall**: Intermediary for application traffic (deep security, higher latency)
  4. **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**: Combines firewall, IDS/IPS, DPI, application awareness (comprehensive, resource-intensive)

  * **Consensus Mechanisms**: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to validate blocks
  * **Immutability**: Each block contains previous block’s hash → tampering changes hashes downstream
  * **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing code stored on blockchain for automated trust
* **Applications for Data Integrity**: Supply chain tracking, financial transactions, digital identity, voting systems
