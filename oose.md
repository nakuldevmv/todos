### 🔑 Steps:

1. **Requirements Elicitation** – Finding out what the user wants
2. **Requirements Analysis** – Removing contradictions, resolving ambiguity
3. **Specification** – Writing the requirements formally (→ SRS)
4. **Validation** – Making sure the requirements are complete and correct

### 🎯 Goal:

Make sure **everyone** (client + devs) knows **exactly** what’s being built. No surprises later.

* **Questionnaires** – Mass data collection
* **Observation** – Watch how current systems work
* **Prototyping** – Show rough version, get feedback
* **Brainstorming** – Get ideas from stakeholders

### 🧠 Analysis Techniques:

* Identify conflicts between user expectations
* Classify into:

  * **Functional Requirements** – What system should do
  * **Non-Functional Requirements** – How well it should do it (speed, security)
* Use **prioritization**, **traceability**, and **feasibility checks**

---

## 3. 📄 **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** 🔥 (Very Important)

## 💡 3. Design Concepts

| Concept                     | Meaning                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**             | Focus only on essential details; hide complexity          |
| **Modularity**              | Divide software into small, manageable parts (modules)    |
| **Information Hiding**      | Hide inner logic from other modules                       |
| **Refinement**              | Develop from general ideas to detailed steps              |
| **Functional Independence** | Keep modules independent via low coupling + high cohesion |
| **Design for Change**       | Build in flexibility for future changes                   |

---

## 🔗 4. Coupling and Cohesion

### 🔌 Coupling (Between modules – should be low)

* **High coupling = Bad** → Modules depend too much on each other
* **Low coupling = Good** → Easy to change one without breaking others

**Types of Coupling:**

* Content (worst)
* Common
* Control
* Stamp
* Data
* No coupling (best)

### 🧬 Cohesion (Within a module – should be high)

* **High cohesion = Good** → Module does one thing well
* **Low cohesion = Bad** → Unrelated responsibilities

**Types of Cohesion:**

* Coincidental (worst)
* Logical
* Temporal
* Procedural
* Communicational
* Sequential
* Functional (best)

✅ **Golden Rule:**
**High Cohesion + Low Coupling = Clean Design**

---

## 🧠 5. Functional Independence

**Meaning:**
Modules should work independently — **self-contained, focused, and loosely connected**.

**Achieved by:**

* Designing for single responsibility
* Minimizing coupling
* Maximizing cohesion

**Benefits:**

* Easier debugging
* Reusability
* Parallel development possible

---

## 🧩 6. Design Patterns

Pre-tested solutions to common design problems.

### 🌐 Model-View-Controller (MVC) – `diagram: true`

Google: `mvc architecture diagram`

* **Model** – Manages data and logic
* **View** – UI/display to the user
* **Controller** – Takes input and updates model/view

Example: In a shopping app

* View = Product page
* Controller = “Add to cart” logic
* Model = Cart data

---

### 🔀 Common Design Patterns

| Pattern               | Purpose & Real-Life Example                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Observer**          | Notify many objects when one changes (📢 News update system)       |
| **Strategy**          | Choose algorithm at runtime (💳 Payment method selection)          |
| **Command**           | Encapsulate requests as objects (🧾 Undo/Redo in Word)             |
| **Adapter**           | Convert interface to another (🔌 Laptop charger adapter)           |
| **Facade**            | Simplified interface to complex system (🏨 Hotel front desk)       |
| **Proxy**             | Placeholder that controls access (🛡️ Firewall or caching server)  |
| **Publish-Subscribe** | Loose communication via events (📬 Newsletter system, event buses) |
