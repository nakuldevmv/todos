## ✅ UNIT III – WIND ENERGY


### 🔹 1. **Wind Energy Principles**

**🔑 Basic Idea:**

* Wind energy is **kinetic energy of moving air**, caused by **solar heating** and **Earth’s rotation**.
* Wind turbines convert this kinetic energy into **mechanical**, then **electrical energy**.

**⚡ Power Equation:**

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot V^3
$$

Where:

* ρ = Air density (kg/m³)
* A = Swept area of rotor (m²)
* V = Wind speed (m/s)

**Key Point:** Power is **proportional to cube of wind speed** → Even a small increase in speed = massive boost in power output.

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind energy power equation with turbine blade diagram`

### 🔹 2. **Wind Site and Resource Assessment**

**Why Site Selection Matters:**

* Wind varies by location. Choosing the wrong site = poor performance & losses.

**🛠️ Tools Used:**

* **Anemometer** – measures wind speed 🌬️
* **Wind Vane** – direction of wind 🧭
* **Wind Rose** – shows frequency of wind directions (pie chart style)
* **LiDAR / SoDAR** – advanced tools to assess wind profile at various heights

**Ideal Site Features:**

* Consistent wind speeds (> 5 m/s at 10m height)
* Low turbulence (flat, open terrain preferred)
* No major obstructions nearby (buildings, trees)
* Available space for rotor blades & tower setup

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind rose diagram site assessment`

---

### 🔹 3. **Wind Assessment**

**Purpose:** Estimate the wind resource and energy output before installing a turbine.

**Key Techniques:**

* **On-site measurements** using masts with sensors (at least 1 year of data).
* **Meteorological station data** (historical analysis).
* **Software modeling tools** (like WAsP) to simulate wind patterns.

**Output:** Wind speed distribution curve (Weibull distribution), monthly averages, and wind energy map of the site.

---

### 🔹 4. **Factors Influencing Wind**

Understanding these helps in better **site planning** and **performance prediction**:

* **Temperature Difference**: Hot air rises → creates pressure difference → wind
* **Altitude**: Wind speed increases with height above ground
* **Coriolis Effect**: Due to Earth’s rotation → wind direction is deflected
* **Topography**: Hills, valleys, forests affect speed & turbulence
* **Time of Day & Season**: Wind varies depending on sunlight & weather
