## ✅ UNIT III – WIND ENERGY


### 🔹 1. **Wind Energy Principles**

**🔑 Basic Idea:**

* Wind energy is **kinetic energy of moving air**, caused by **solar heating** and **Earth’s rotation**.
* Wind turbines convert this kinetic energy into **mechanical**, then **electrical energy**.

**⚡ Power Equation:**

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot V^3
$$

Where:

* ρ = Air density (kg/m³)
* A = Swept area of rotor (m²)
* V = Wind speed (m/s)

**Key Point:** Power is **proportional to cube of wind speed** → Even a small increase in speed = massive boost in power output.

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind energy power equation with turbine blade diagram`

---

### 🔹 2. **Wind Site and Resource Assessment**

**Why Site Selection Matters:**

* Wind varies by location. Choosing the wrong site = poor performance & losses.

**🛠️ Tools Used:**

* **Anemometer** – measures wind speed 🌬️
* **Wind Vane** – direction of wind 🧭
* **Wind Rose** – shows frequency of wind directions (pie chart style)
* **LiDAR / SoDAR** – advanced tools to assess wind profile at various heights

**Ideal Site Features:**

* Consistent wind speeds (> 5 m/s at 10m height)
* Low turbulence (flat, open terrain preferred)
* No major obstructions nearby (buildings, trees)
* Available space for rotor blades & tower setup

📌 **diagram: true**
🔍 *Search:* `wind rose diagram site assessment`

---

### 🔹 3. **Wind Assessment**

**Purpose:** Estimate the wind resource and energy output before installing a turbine.

**Key Techniques:**

* **On-site measurements** using masts with sensors (at least 1 year of data).
* **Meteorological station data** (historical analysis).
* **Software modeling tools** (like WAsP) to simulate wind patterns.

**Output:** Wind speed distribution curve (Weibull distribution), monthly averages, and wind energy map of the site.

---

### 🔹 4. **Factors Influencing Wind**

Understanding these helps in better **site planning** and **performance prediction**:

* **Temperature Difference**: Hot air rises → creates pressure difference → wind
* **Altitude**: Wind speed increases with height above ground
* **Coriolis Effect**: Due to Earth’s rotation → wind direction is deflected
* **Topography**: Hills, valleys, forests affect speed & turbulence

* **Hot dry rock**

### 🔹 Types of Wells

* **Production Well**: Extracts steam/hot water
* **Injection Well**: Returns used fluid to maintain pressure

### 🔹 Methods of Harnessing

* **Dry steam plant** – oldest, uses natural steam
* **Flash steam plant** – converts hot water into steam
* **Binary cycle** – transfers heat to secondary fluid (used when temp is low)

### 🔹 Potential in India

* **Puga (Ladakh), Manikaran (HP), Tattapani (Chhattisgarh)**

## 🌊 3. **OTEC – Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion**

### 🔹 What is OTEC?

* Generates power using **temperature difference** between **warm surface water** (\~25°C) and **cold deep water** (\~5°C)
* Only works in **tropical oceans** 🌴

### 🔹 Working Principles

* Heat from warm surface water boils a **working fluid** → drives turbine → power.

### 🔹 Thermodynamic Cycles:

* **Closed Cycle**: Uses fluid like ammonia.
* **Open Cycle**: Uses sea water directly.
* **Hybrid Cycle**: Mix of both.

### 🔹 Site Conditions

* Minimum temp difference = **20°C**
* Best for **coastal and island regions**

## 🌊 4. **Tidal and Wave Energy**

### 🔹 Tidal Energy

* Caused by **gravitational pull** of the moon + sun 🌕🌊
* Types:

  * **Tidal barrage** (dam-like)
  * **Tidal stream** (uses underwater turbines)
  * **Dynamic tidal power**

### 🔹 Wave Energy

* Comes from **surface waves** formed by wind
* Conversion Devices:

  * **Oscillating water column**
  * **Point absorbers**
  * **Overtopping devices**

### 🔹 Comparison

| Aspect         | Tidal  | Wave       |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Predictability | High   | Moderate   |
| Tech Maturity  | Higher | Developing |
| Cost           | High   | Very high  |

## 💧 5. **Mini-Hydel Power Plants and Their Economics**

### 🔹 What Is Mini-Hydel?

* Small hydroelectric power systems **(<25 MW)**
* No large dams needed; **run-of-river** most common.

### 🔹 Types of Mini-Hydel:

* **Canal-based**
* **Dam-toe**
* **Diversion-type**

### 🔹 Components:

* **Intake → Penstock → Turbine → Generator → Tailrace**

### 🔹 Economic Aspects:

* Initial cost: ₹7–10 Cr per MW
* O\&M cost: Very low
* Life span: 30+ years
* Suitable for **rural electrification**
