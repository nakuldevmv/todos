## ✍️ ✨ **Sample 13-Mark Answer** ✨

> Primary energy sources are the natural sources of energy used in raw form. They are classified into renewable (solar, wind, hydro) and non-renewable (coal, oil, gas). Renewable energy is eco-friendly, infinite, and essential for sustainable development, unlike fossil fuels which are polluting and depleting.
>
> India is rich in renewables, with solar energy in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, wind energy in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, and biomass in Punjab and West Bengal. As of 2024, the total installed renewable energy capacity in India is around 145 GW, with solar leading the chart.
>
> Looking ahead, India targets 500 GW from non-fossil sources by 2030. The government is supporting innovations like floating solar, offshore wind, smart grids, and hybrid energy systems.
>
> With such vast resources and strong policy support, renewable energy is not only vital for India’s sustainable future but also a major driver for economic and technological growth.
