## 1. **UI vs UX Design**

`diagram: false`

### ✨ UI (User Interface)

* Refers to the **visual part** the user interacts with (buttons, layouts, typography, colors).
* It’s about **aesthetics and responsiveness**.
* Example: The color of a button, the menu layout, hover animations.

### 🧠 UX (User Experience)

* Refers to the **overall experience** the user has while using the product.
* It’s about **usefulness, flow, and satisfaction**.
* Example: How easy it is to book a ticket or find information.

### 💥 Key Differences

| UI                      | UX                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Visuals & presentation  | Experience & functionality |
| Focuses on how it looks | Focuses on how it works    |
| Comes *after* UX        | Comes *before* UI          |

> 📌 **Exam Tip**: Write definitions, show a comparison table, and give a real-world app example (like Swiggy, Netflix etc.).

## 2. **Core Stages of Design Thinking**

`diagram: true`
**Google search**: `Design thinking 5 stages diagram`

### 🌀 What is Design Thinking?

It’s a **problem-solving approach** focused on understanding users and creating human-centered solutions.

### 🧩 5 Stages:

1. **Empathize** – Observe and understand user needs/emotions.
2. **Define** – Narrow down the exact problem to solve.
3. **Ideate** – Think wild, brainstorm as many solutions as possible.
4. **Prototype** – Build quick, low-cost models to visualize the idea.
5. **Test** – Get feedback and improve the solution.

> ✍️ **Remember**: E-D-I-P-T (Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test)

### 📌 Common Questions:

* Explain any **2 or 3 stages** with examples.
* What is the importance of design thinking?

## 3. **Divergent and Convergent Thinking**

`diagram: true`
**Google search**: `divergent vs convergent thinking in design thinking diagram`

### 🌈 Divergent Thinking

* Think wide and wild.
* Generate **many ideas**, no judgment.
* Used during **ideation** phase.

### 🎯 Convergent Thinking

* Focus and filter ideas.
* **Select the best** solution based on feasibility and impact.
* Used during **define** and **test** phases.

> 📌 Tip: Think like this — *"Diverge to explore 🌪️, converge to decide 🎯"*

## 4. **Brainstorming and Game storming**

`diagram: false`

### 🧠 Brainstorming

* Group activity to spark ideas.
* Rules:

  * Defer judgment
  * Go for quantity
  * Encourage wild ideas
  * Build on others’ ideas

### 🎲 Gamestorming

* Same goal as brainstorming, but adds **games or structured play** to unlock creativity.
* Examples:

  * Role-play
  * Crazy 8’s (8 ideas in 8 mins)
  * Card sorting

> 📌 Exam Tip: Write 3 rules of brainstorming + name one gamestorming activity with purpose.

## 5. **Observational Empathy**

`diagram: true`
**Google search**: `empathy map UX example`

### 👀 What it is:

* Observing users in real environments to understand their pain points, emotions, and goals.
* Helps designers build solutions **from the user’s point of view**.

### 🗺️ Tool: Empathy Map

* Divides user insights into:

  * What they **Say**
  * What they **Think**
  * What they **Do**
  * What they **Feel**

### 🔍 Example:

* Watching how users interact with a mobile app while commuting, taking notes on where they struggle.

> 📌 Common question: Explain empathy with example or diagram (empathy map).
