## 🔷 **1. UI vs UX Design**

> Understand how **UI** (look & feel) and **UX** (overall experience) work together.

### 🖌️ **UI – User Interface**

* Visual elements: color palettes, typography, icons, imagery, animation
* Layout and grid systems for consistent placement
* Interactive components: buttons, toggles, form fields, micro‑interactions
* Tools & Deliverables: Figma/Sketch mockups, style tiles, component libraries
* **Additional:** Accessibility considerations (contrast ratios, touch target sizes)

### 🌈 **UX – User Experience**

* End-to-end journey: onboarding, task flows, support, exit points
* Emotional and cognitive aspects: delight, frustration, trust
* Research-driven: personas, journey maps, empathy maps
* Tools & Deliverables: user flow diagrams, usability reports, information architecture
* **Additional:** Metrics such as NPS, task success rate, SUS scores

🧠 **Common exam line:**

> “UI focuses on the product’s look and interactive elements, while UX encompasses the entire user journey, ensuring usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.”

### 📚 **Extra Content:**

* **Overlap:** UI is a subset of UX – good UI enhances UX but doesn’t guarantee it
* **Real-world example:** Compare Swiggy’s intuitive UI vs. pain points in its UX flow (e.g., order tracking)

## 🔷 **2. Core Stages of Design Thinking**

`diagram: true`
**Google this:** `design thinking process simplified`

Design Thinking is a **human-centered** approach that emphasizes understanding users and iteratively solving problems.

### 🔹 **a. Empathize**

* Activities: contextual inquiry, stakeholder interviews, diary studies
* Tools: empathy maps (Say/Think/Do/Feel), persona interviews
* **Outcomes:** user needs, pain point summaries, raw quotes

### 🔹 **b. Define**

* Create a **Point of View** (POV) statement: "\[User] needs \[need] because \[insight]"
* Methods: Affinity mapping to cluster insights, HMW (How Might We) questions
* **Outcomes:** clear problem statements, design briefs, scope definitions

### 🔹 **c. Ideate**

* Techniques: Brainstorming, Brainwriting, SCAMPER, mind maps
* Emphasis: quantity over quality, no idea is too wild
* **Outcomes:** idea backlog, concept sketches, prioritization matrices

### 🔹 **d. Prototype**

* Fidelity levels: paper, digital wireframes, interactive prototypes
* Tools: Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD, InVision
* **Outcomes:** clickable prototypes, key screen mockups, UI kits

### 🔹 **e. Test**

* Methods: usability testing (moderated/unmoderated), A/B testing, heuristic evaluation
* Metrics: task completion rate, error rate, time-on-task, satisfaction ratings
* **Outcomes:** usability reports, prioritized recommendations, iteration plan

💡 **Pro Tip:** The process is **iterative** – continually circle back as new insights emerge.

## 🌐 UNIT IV – Wireframing, Prototyping, and Testing

**diagram: true** (especially for wireflows, prototypes, usability test layouts)
**Google these:**
`Wireflow vs Prototype`, `Sketching Red Routes`, `High-Fidelity Mockup Examples`, `Usability Testing UI UX`

---

### ✍️ Sketching Principles

* Rough, fast, hand-drawn ideas to visualize screen layouts & flows
* Not meant to be pretty — just functional
* Helps **communicate ideas quickly**, especially in early design phase
* Encourages **collaboration**, iteration, and creativity
* **Best Practices:**

  * Use paper or whiteboards
  * Keep it low-detail
  * Use arrows to show screen transitions

---

### 🚦 Sketching Red Routes

* **Red Routes** = the **core, frequently-used tasks** users must complete quickly
* Eg: In a food delivery app, red routes = Search > Select Food > Checkout
* Helps prioritize features that need **speed, ease, and visibility**
* Focus sketches & designs **only on key journeys**
* Saves time and avoids over-designing non-essential stuff

---

### 📱 Responsive Design

* Making your UI look good on **multiple screen sizes** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Uses **fluid grids**, **flexible images**, and **media queries**
* Keeps content **consistent** and **accessible** across devices
* Important because **users don’t just use one device**
* Also improves SEO and usability

---

### 🧱 Wireframing

* A **blueprint of your interface** — shows layout & elements without visuals/colors
* Think: A skeleton or layout preview
* Helps **plan placement** of buttons, headers, content, navigation etc
* Doesn’t show **branding or interaction** — just structure
* Tools: Figma (low-fi), Balsamiq, Adobe XD
* Types:

  * **Low Fidelity (Lo-Fi)** → Basic sketch
  * **Mid Fidelity** → Grayscale + placeholders
  * **High Fidelity** → Looks close to real app (but still non-functional)

---

### 🔀 Creating Wireflows

* **Wireframe + Flowchart** = Wireflow
* Shows **how users move** between wireframes
* Each screen has arrows showing interaction flow
* Great for visualizing **navigation logic** and **user decisions**
* Helpful in early client discussions
* **Diagram: true** → search: `wireflow examples`

---

### 🔧 Building a Prototype

* **Interactive model** of the app/site (can be clicked, tested)
* Mimics actual app flow — but not real code
* Used to **test design logic, UI, user journey**
* Helps in **gathering early feedback**
* **Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, InVision
* **Types:**

  * **Lo-Fi Prototypes:** simple interactions
  * **Hi-Fi Prototypes:** close to final product feel

---

### 🎨 Building High-Fidelity Mockups

* **Final UI designs** — looks pixel-perfect
* Includes branding, icons, images, fonts, real text
* Shows **exact design** users will see
* Often used for **dev handoff**
* Built after user flow & wireframes are finalized

---

### 🛠️ Designing Efficiently with Tools

* Use tools like:

  * **Figma:** collaborative UI design
  * **InVision:** prototyping & feedback
  * **Adobe XD:** design + prototyping
* Use **components**, **auto-layout**, and **libraries** to save time
* Use **design systems** for consistency

---

### 🔁 Interaction Patterns

* **Standard, reusable design solutions** to common problems
* Eg: Pull-to-refresh, hamburger menu, infinite scroll
* Help maintain **consistency** across app/web pages
* Boost **user familiarity** (users already know how they work)
* Reuse these instead of reinventing the wheel

---

### 🧪 Conducting Usability Tests

* Real users use the product to find **bugs, confusion, friction**
* Observe **how users interact**, what confuses them
* Done with prototypes or MVPs
* Techniques:

  * **Think-Aloud Protocol**
  * **A/B Testing**
  * **Remote or in-person testing**
* **Metrics Collected:**

  * Task completion rate
  * Time to complete tasks
  * Error rate
  * Satisfaction score

---

### 🔍 Other Evaluative User Research Methods

* **Surveys, interviews, focus groups, eye-tracking**
* Purpose = get **feedback on usability, satisfaction, needs**
* Used to **validate your design decisions**
* Done **after initial prototype testing**
* Helps make informed refinements

---

### 🧠 Synthesizing Test Findings

* Analyze test results:

  * **Where users struggled**
  * **Common pain points**
  * **Success rates**
* Identify **design flaws**
* Create a **summary report**
* Prioritize fixes based on **impact & effort**

---

### 🔄 Prototype Iteration

* Use test feedback to **refine and improve** the prototype
* Repeat this:

  1. Build
  2. Test
  3. Analyze
  4. Improve
* Each loop makes product **more user-friendly**
* Final version = **polished, tested and verified**
