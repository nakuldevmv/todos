## 🔷 1. UI vs UX Design

> Understand the **difference** between how a product looks (UI) and how it works (UX).

### 🖌️ **UI – User Interface**

* Visual design of the product
* Includes: Colors, typography, layout, icons, spacing
* Focuses on **aesthetic appeal** and **interactivity**
* Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch

### 🌈 **UX – User Experience**

* Entire user journey and interaction
* Includes: User research, usability, logic, emotion
* Focuses on **solving user problems effectively**

🧠 **Common exam line:**

> “UI is about the look and feel; UX is about the user's experience and satisfaction.”

## 🔷 2. Core Stages of Design Thinking

`diagram: true`
**Google this:** `design thinking process simplified`

Design Thinking = A 5-phase **human-centered** design process used to solve real-world problems.

### 🔹 a. Empathize

* Understand the user’s environment, pain points, and behavior
* Methods: Interviews, observations, empathy maps
* 🧠 *Divergent thinking phase*

### 🔹 b. Define

* Convert observations into clear problem statements
* Tool: Point of View (POV) statement
* 🧠 *Convergent thinking phase*

### 🔹 c. Ideate

* Generate wild and wide range of creative solutions
* Techniques: Brainstorming, gamestorming, mind maps
* 🧠 *Divergent thinking phase*

### 🔹 d. Prototype

* Build quick, rough versions of ideas (low or high fidelity)
* Goal: Get feedback quickly
* 🧠 *Convergent thinking phase*

### 🔹 e. Test

* Show prototypes to real users and collect feedback
* Use: Usability tests, A/B testing
* 🧠 *Both divergent & convergent*

💡 Pro Tip: **Design Thinking is not linear**. You can loop back and forth between stages.

## 🔷 3. Divergent & Convergent Thinking

`diagram: false`

These are **mental modes** used across the design process.

### 🌪️ Divergent Thinking

* Expand your thinking
* Generate **many ideas**
* Encourages creativity, quantity > quality
* **Used in:** Empathize, Ideate, Test

### 🎯 Convergent Thinking

* Focus your thinking
* **Filter and select** the best ideas
* Prioritize based on value, feasibility
* **Used in:** Define, Prototype, Test

🧠 Common line:

> “Design Thinking alternates between diverging to explore and converging to focus.”

## 🔷 4. Brainstorming & Gamestorming

`diagram: false`

These are **techniques used during Divergent Thinking**, mostly in the **Ideate stage**.

### 🧠 Brainstorming

* Free flow of ideas in a group or solo
* No judgments or filters
* Aim: **Get as many ideas as possible**

### 🎲 Gamestorming

* Creative activities that act like games to spark ideas
* Makes brainstorming fun + structured
* Examples:

  * **Crazy 8s** – draw 8 ideas in 8 minutes
  * **Card sorting** – organize ideas visually
  * **Role-playing** – step into the user’s shoes

💡 Gamestorming = Brainstorming + Game mechanics = More engagement

## 🔷 5. Observational Empathy

`diagram: true`
**Google this:** `UX empathy map example`

This is the heart of **Empathize phase** in Design Thinking.

### 👀 What It Means:

* Observe real users in their natural environments
* Focus on **what users say, do, think, and feel**
* Helps identify unspoken pain points
* Builds **deep emotional connection** with users

### 🧰 Tools:

* Empathy maps
* User shadowing
* Field research
* Contextual inquiry

🧠 Common line:

> “Observational empathy enables designers to see the product through the user’s eyes.”
