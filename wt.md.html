# üåê UNIT I: Website Basics, HTML5, CSS3 & Web 2.0

## ‚úÖ Web Essentials

* **Client**: The browser you use (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to open and interact with websites. It sends out requests and receives responses.
* **Server**: A powerful remote computer that stores and serves web pages and data. It listens for requests and sends resources back.
* **Communication**: They talk using **HTTP**, a protocol that powers all web requests. Think of it like digital mail exchange.

## ‚úÖ Internet & WWW

* **Internet**: A global system of interconnected computer networks that communicate through standard protocols like TCP/IP. It is the infrastructure for all online services.
* **WWW (World Wide Web)**: A service on top of the internet, made up of millions of websites and multimedia linked together using hyperlinks.
* **URL**: Uniform Resource Locator ‚Äì the unique address of any resource on the web (like `https://example.com`). It identifies the location and protocol.

## ‚úÖ HTTP Request & Response

* **Request**: The browser sends a message asking the server for a webpage. Contains method, headers, and data.
* **Response**: The server sends back the required files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.). Includes status code and content.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `HTTP request response cycle diagram`)

## ‚úÖ Web Clients & Web Servers

* **Clients**: Devices or applications (browsers) that send requests to servers. They act as the interface for users.
* **Servers**: Systems that process those requests and deliver responses. They store files, databases, and backend logic.

## ‚úÖ HTML5

* Defines the structure of a webpage using elements and tags.
* New semantic tags: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc., make pages more readable by humans and machines.
* Supports **tables**, **lists**, **images** for organizing and displaying content.
* **Form Controls**: `<input>`, `<button>`, `<select>` elements for user input. Includes new types like date, email, range.
* **Drag & Drop**: Allows moving elements within the page with native support.
* **Audio/Video**: Native support to embed and control multimedia like podcasts or MP4s.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `HTML5 form elements`)

## ‚úÖ CSS3

* Adds style and visual formatting to HTML elements using selectors and properties.
* Applied via Inline, Embedded, or External stylesheets for modular styling.
* **Cascading**: Rules are prioritized based on origin and specificity.
* **Inheritance**: Styles pass down from parent to child elements unless overridden.
* Includes properties like **backgrounds**, **borders**, **colors**, **shadows**, **text effects**.
* **Transformations**: Rotate, scale, skew elements with properties like `transform`.
* **Transitions**: Animate changes smoothly using `transition` properties.
* **Animations**: Loop or sequence animations using `@keyframes`.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `CSS3 properties cheat sheet`)

## ‚úÖ Bootstrap Framework

* A popular CSS framework for responsive, mobile-first sites that scales across devices.
* Pre-built components: grid systems, buttons, modals, navbars, cards, etc.
* Speeds up design and layout with ready-to-use classes and JavaScript plugins.

# üíª UNIT II: Client Side Programming (JavaScript, JSON)

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Introduction

* A high-level, interpreted scripting language that brings interactivity to web pages.
* Runs in the browser and powers features like sliders, popups, form checks, etc.
* Reacts to events like clicks, typing, scrolling, and hovering.

## ‚úÖ DOM (Document Object Model)

* Represents page structure as a tree of elements that JS can interact with.
* JS can read and manipulate the DOM in real time to update content or styling.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `DOM tree structure html`)

## ‚úÖ Exception Handling

* Manages errors using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to avoid crashes.
* Ensures smoother user experience by handling invalid inputs and failures.

## ‚úÖ Form Validation

* JS checks form fields before submission to ensure correctness.
* Example: Ensures email field has `@` character and no blank fields.
* Improves UX and reduces unnecessary server load.

## ‚úÖ Built-in Objects

* Powerful built-ins like `Math`, `Date`, `Array`, `String`, `JSON`, etc.
* Provide utility methods for calculations, string manipulation, data storage, etc.

## ‚úÖ Event Handling

* Detects and responds to user actions: `onclick`, `onchange`, `onmouseover`, etc.
* Enables dynamic content updates and rich interactions.

## ‚úÖ DHTML

* A mix of HTML, CSS, JS, and DOM for interactive web pages.
* Enables animations, real-time changes, and effects without page reloads.

## ‚úÖ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

* A lightweight format to store and exchange data.
* Easy to read, write, and parse.
* Widely used in APIs and AJAX calls.
* Example: `{ "name": "Alex", "age": 21 }`

---

# üñ• UNIT III: Server Side Programming (Servlets & JDBC)

## ‚úÖ Java Servlets

* Java classes that run on a web server to generate dynamic web content.
* Process user input, handle forms, interact with databases, and control flow.

## ‚úÖ Servlet Life Cycle

1. **init()** ‚Äì Initializes the servlet; runs once when servlet is created.
2. **service()** ‚Äì Called each time a request is received.
3. **destroy()** ‚Äì Cleans up before servlet is unloaded.

* **diagram: true** (Google: `Java servlet life cycle`)

## ‚úÖ Form Submission Methods

* **GET**: Data is appended to the URL; useful for queries; visible and limited.
* **POST**: Data is sent securely in the request body; suitable for sensitive or large data.

## ‚úÖ Session Handling

* Tracks user data across multiple pages using `HttpSession`.
* Useful for shopping carts, login sessions, and user preferences.

## ‚úÖ Cookies

* Small text files stored in user's browser.
* Stores preferences, session info, and helps personalize experiences.

## ‚úÖ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

* Connects Java apps to relational databases like MySQL or Oracle.
* Steps:

  1. Load JDBC driver.
  2. Establish a DB connection.
  3. Create and execute SQL queries.
  4. Handle ResultSet.
  5. Close connection properly.

# üß© UNIT IV: PHP & XML

## ‚úÖ PHP Basics

* A server-side scripting language for backend logic.
* Embeds seamlessly into HTML to build dynamic sites.
* Processes form data, interacts with DBs, and handles sessions.

## ‚úÖ Key PHP Concepts

* **Variables**: Store values (`$name = "Alex"`)
* **Control Flow**: Logic using `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` statements.
* **Functions**: Reusable blocks; built-in like `strlen()` or user-defined.
* **Form Validation**: Ensures submitted data is valid and safe.

## ‚úÖ XML Basics

* Markup language to structure and transport data.
* Tags describe data ‚Äì machine and human readable.

## ‚úÖ DTD (Document Type Definition)

* Declares rules and structure of XML to validate documents.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `XML DTD example`)

## ‚úÖ XSD (XML Schema Definition)

* Defines allowed elements, attributes, and data types.
* Ensures stricter validation than DTD.
* **diagram: true** (Google: `XSD schema example`)

## ‚úÖ Namespaces

* Prevent tag name conflicts by qualifying names.
* Declared using `xmlns` attributes.
* Example:


## ‚úÖ XML Parsers

* **DOM**: Loads entire XML into memory; easy navigation.
* **SAX**: Parses XML sequentially; memory efficient.
* **StAX**: Offers programmer control with event-driven parsing.

## ‚úÖ XSL

* Styles or transforms XML to formats like HTML.
* Makes XML readable or suitable for presentation.
